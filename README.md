# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project implements various **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** in C++.  
It includes a command-line interface (CLI) and will later have a **web-based visualization** using ReactJs and D3.js.

## ðŸ“Œ Algorithms Implemented
- [ ] First Come First Serve (**FCFS**)
- [ ] Shortest Job First (**SJF**)
- [ ] Shortest Remaining Time First (**SRTF**)
- [ ] Round Robin (**RR**)
- [ ] Priority Scheduling
- [ ] Multilevel Queue (**MLQ**)
